Hello dearest internet,
This first post is going to be quick & unexciting.
Do I have you roped in, yet?
This is mostly a test post, so why not give a shout out to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for helping things stay uniform & [jmcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages) for teaching me how to do all this.
Let's hope this looks alright?
-Phoenix
