<l1>This is a web adaptation of the interactive sculpture <i>Playing the Victim</i>. <br> The piece triggers 5 audio pieces about rape, rape culture, transphobia, trans erasure, and hate crimes. <br> To similuate the experience of the sculpture, click on any of the 5 metal bits: half a penny, two halves of a screw, and two halves of a blade; which each give a piece of the narrative. <br> Also, click inside the larger eye socket for a sense of what it is to be a trans survivor of sexual assault. <br> Please, wear headphones or use stereo speakers. </l1>
