				<p>I wear a lot of labels. Through my work and my life, I've accpeted that people like to reduce one another to a string of identifiers. I decided to have a lot of them.</p>
				<p>My work integrates physical media such as drawing, painting, physical comptuing, sculpture, installation, laser cutting, and found materials with digital media including video, audio, 3D modleing, graphic design, motion capture, and augmented reality./p>
