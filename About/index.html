	<H1>Phoenix Lio(n)</H1>
	<p>Phoenix Lio(n) Egages technology and artistic practice to disrupt the ways in which the physical world is invoked to justify oppression and marginalization. They rebuild their mind, their memories, and the world around them by layering media and mediums. By engaging their experiences and identity as tools for art they rework the heaviest, hardest parts of themself like pigments dragged across canvas.</p>
