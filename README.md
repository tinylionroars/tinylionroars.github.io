my website<br><br>
<b>Concept</b><br><br>
My portfolio will be a space designed for user control that is meant to seem almost like a living entity.<br>
The flow of the site will mostly be a tagging system, with four different types of tags:<br>
type (augmented reality, audio, installation, etc),<br>
concepts/themes (queerness, bodies, mental illness, etc),<br>
narative (building nonlinear stories by putting linked pages under a tag with the title),<br>
user added (users can add tags to pages)<br>
<br>
Other elements that will give the user more autonomy are:<br>
draggable elements, allowing the user the ability to determine the page layout<br>
super unstyled html buttons that toggle the visibility of specific elements/backrgound<br>
giving some pages things like text boxes that appear on the page as a p element that fade out with global page refreshes<br>
asking permission & giving content warnings with js alerts<br>
<br>
The other core focuses in this pass are adding more pages/projects & making the site more accessible<br>

<br><br><b> Things to do: </b> <br><br>
  Add more c o n t e n t<br>
  Forms to tags (decay factor? show tags on screen(with button toggle)?<br>
  Html button toggles for content & backgrounds<br>
  Search system (clean, narrative, user)<br>
  Create a page with input boxes that people can enter & send to movable text boxes in random place with random background with random alpha with decay factor (changing alpha, when alpha <= 0, delete--create counter for # of visits to page?)<br>
  Fix text box things (opacity & repeat)<br>
  Toggle text box background on/off<br>
  Accessibility!<br>
  Fix draggable (background, default layout, less trash(sticky?), opacity)<br>
  Autoplay & ask to use (as alerts)<br>
  Ask to use for as many diff types of data available to show what can & is tracked ayyyyyyyyyyy<br>
  Sketches as background<br>
  Save user settings?<br>
  Default layout<br>
  Use random background & determine color from background?<br>
  Fix how js appears on screen (below footer)<br>
